## Summary
I analyzed the NBA players' stats data with the longitudinal analysis methods, linear mixed model and GEE for SNU 2022 Spring Analysis of Repeated Measurements Final Project. 
The aims of the study are to figure out how NBA players’ play types affect their performance and how their performance changes over time.

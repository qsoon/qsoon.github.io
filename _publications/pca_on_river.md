## Abstract
We developed a PCA method to reflect the unique characteristics of river networks. The strengths of our approach are that it can 
(i) reduce dimensionality for streamflow data while effectively removing correlation among them and 
(ii) identify the group structure of data.

## Contribution
I proposed a new PCA method applicable to River Network Data.
